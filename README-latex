The LaTeX source files in this repository rely on some style files
that are not present and not part of the standard texlive
distribution.

In order to use them you need to run the command

git clone https://github.com/gdg8/csstyles.git

in a directory where LaTeX will find them.

On a Mac a good place is in ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex
On Linux it's ~/texmf/tex/latex

You also need an up to date version of texlive (we have used the 2013 distribution)

Note: If you are using TexLive 2014, you may need to remove or rename the file
mdframed.sty in the csstyles directory, as a newer version is available as part
of the TexLive distribution.
