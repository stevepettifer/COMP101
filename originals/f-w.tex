There are many positive integer solutions to the equation
\[
x^2 + y^2 =  z^2
\]
which can be rewritten as
\[
z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
For example \((3,4, 5)\) or \((5,12,13)\). Such solutions
are called \emph{Pythagorean triples}.

However, for higher powers the situation is very different,
and we have:-

\noindent \textbf{Theorem: Fermat-Wiles}\\
For all natural numbers \(n \ge 3 \), there are no integers
$x, y, z$ satisfying the equation
\[
x^n + y^n = z^n
\]
